Stage 3 – JAVASCRIPT:
You have learned how your site will look like, you have designed the beauty of your page yet. Now, it turns to creating some useful tasks that your web page elements will do when some activities are performed on your web pages like button click events, mouse over any text, playing and pausing some animations on the page, etc. With the help of JAVASCRIPT, you can do that easily. One of the best scripting languages used to make a web page more smooth, flexible and platform-independent is javascript. It’s not that easy to learn but whatever you learned at an easy level, will be enough to do your all tasks.
