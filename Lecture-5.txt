Stage 1 – HTML:
HTML, you have heard about it lots of times before. If I am not wrong HTML is the language you have learned in your school life. Yes, it’s actually the same as what you have learned a long time ago but as long as time changes technologies are changing. Nowadays as you have grown up, even HTML has grown up too, now there is called HTML5 comes into existence. What? Worried about what is it? Don’t be. I just said that as we have grown up HTML has grown up too but the difference between us and HTML is, it changed its name to HTML5. In HTML5, you can not just prepare the basic structure of the web page but we have many more things that we can do. We can store and process values on variables on-page itself without any databases as we do in any programming language (Temporary variables), we can develop games on it. No need for the flash to play animations on it. Even we can develop a fully functional blog with HTML4 itself without any help to server-side scripting languages.&
